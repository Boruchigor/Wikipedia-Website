    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori near Hida. She is bored with abnormal life and wishes to be a handsome Tokyo boy in her next life. She begins to switch bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, phones and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school. One day, Mitsuha accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the family sisters and as an offering at the Shinto shrine on a mountaintop outside the town. It is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Taki reads the note from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat expected to pass Earth on the day of the festival. The next day, Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki. Taki tries to call Mitsuha, but cannot reach her and the body-switching ends.

        Taki, Miki and Tsukasa travel to Gifu Prefecture by train, but not knowing the town's name Taki has to rely on the memory for the scenery. A male restaurant owner in Hida recognizes Itomori from the sketchbook. He tells Taki and his friends that a giant meteor crashed onto Earth, and destroyed the town after the comet unexpectedly broke into pieces. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that everyone in town had died this whole time, Taki sees that Mitsuha's information has been permanently deleted from his phone and their memories start fading away. Taki finds each names in town in the record of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years. While Miki and Tsukasa return to Tokyo, Taki goes to the shrine alone to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet. Through a vision, Taki learns that he met Mitsuha on the train, not knowing they were separated for three years. She had instead met his past self while trying to meet with him personally.
        
        He wakes up in her body at the house on the morning. Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what happened, and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history and caretakers for the shrine. Taki convinces Tessie and Sayaka, two of Mitsuha's friends, to make everyone evacuate the town, by disabling the electrical substation and broadcasting a false emergency alert, while Taki assumes Mitsuha's role as the mayor's daughter. Realizing that Mitsuha is in his body at the shrine, Taki goes back to find her and Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body. When Taki reaches there during the sunset, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years, but when twilight falls (referred to in the film as "magic hour" or "kataware-doki"),[note 1] they return to their own bodies and meet. After Taki returns the braid for Mitsuha, they attempt to write their names on each hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers. When the evacuation plan fails, Mitsuha determines to convince her father and evacuate the town. Before doing so, Mitsuha notices her memories for Taki starting to fade, and discovers he wrote "I love you" on her hand instead of his name. Despite the evacuation, the comet piece crashes to Earth and destroys the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.
        
        Five years later, Taki has graduated from university and searches for a job. He senses he lost something important, but feels drawn to the disaster after learning that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when the trains draw parallel, and they separately disembark and search for themselves, finally meeting at the stairs of Suga Shrine [ja]. As they initially walk past the stairway, they see each other. Taki sees Mitsuha again and she responds with the same feeling. With their connection re-established, they shed tears of happiness and simultaneously ask for their names. </p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <hr>
        <pre>
            <strong>Taki Tachibana</strong> (立花 瀧, Tachibana Taki)
    Voiced by: Ryunosuke Kamiki[5] (Japanese); Michael Sinterniklaas (English)[6][7]

    A high school student currently living in Tokyo. He was a 17 year old sophomore attending at Tokyo Metropolitan High School and in the class next to Class C of second year. Taki was actually three years younger than Mitsuha when they started switching bodies. He is also an architect. He is short-tempered but well meaning and kind. He spends time with Miki Okudera, working in a part-time job as a waiter at the Italian restaurant "Il Giardino delle Parole"[a]. When Taki swaps with Mitsuha, he fondles her breasts every time she wakes up, and her younger sister, Yotsuha, who has come to wake her up, sees him rubbing it. So when he and Mitsuha met in person during twilight, she complained about it. Taki later appeared in Shinkai's next film Weathering with You.

    His birthday contradicts with the film's setting of 17 years old in the summer of his sophomore year, but Shinkai said, "In their mind, they both kind of assumed that they were both born on December 1." He lives with his father, who works at Kasumigaseki, and Shinkai stated, "I think his mother divorced his father a few years ago."[8]

            <strong>Mitsuha Miyamizu</strong> (宮水 三葉, Miyamizu Mitsuha)
    Voiced by: Mone Kamishiraishi[5] (Japanese); Stephanie Sheh[7] (English)

    A high school girl dissatisfied with her life in Itomori, a mountainous and rural town of Gifu Prefecture. She is a 17-year-old student in her second year at Itomori High School. She was actually three years older than Taki when they started switching bodies. She ties her hair with dark red braid. She and her sister are maidens of the family shrine. Her mother died peacefully, and her father left home in order to become the town's mayor. She lives with her grandmother, Hitoha, and her younger sister, Yotsuha, who is in elementary school. Mitsuha wishes to have a better life in Tokyo from respecting the shrine and having a strained relationship with her father. She is embarrassed by often open displays of control, as well as the part as a miko in rituals for the family shrine, with kuchikamizake, an ancient traditional way of making sake by chewing rice to intake yeast for fermentation. When switching bodies with Taki, Mitsuha forbids him from touching himself without permission. Mitsuha later appeared in Shinkai's next film Weathering with You.

    Like Taki, her birthday contradicts with the film's setting that she was 17 years old in the summer of his sophomore year, but Shinkai said, "In their mind, they both kind of assumed that they were both born on December 1."[8]

    In December 2021, he talked about his upcoming marriage to Sayaka.

    Teshigawara is named after Aizawa Shoko's middle school friend, Teshigawara, who appears in the seventh episode of Shinkai's novel The Garden of Words (Kotonoha no Niwa).[8][9]

She is more commonly referred to as Ms. Okudera (Okudera-senpai) by her colleagues.

    When she met Taki in 2021 after a long time, she was wearing an engagement ring and told him that she was getting married soon. Shinkai revealed, "It's just a backstory, but I believe that Tsukasa is engaged to Okudera."[8] In the original novel, she is described as working at the Chiba branch of an apparel manufacturer as of 2021.

<h2>Production</h2>
<hr>
<p>The idea for this story came to Shinkai, after he visited Yuriage, Natori, Miyagi Prefecture in July 2011, after the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred. He said, "This could have been my town." He said that he wanted to make a movie in which the positions of the people in Yuriage would be swapped with the viewers. The sketches that Shinkai drew during this visit have been shown in exhibitions.

    In Makoto Shinkai's proposal sent to Toho on September 14, 2014, the film was originally titled <strong>Yume to Shiriseba</strong> (夢と知りせば, If I Knew It Was a Dream), derived from a passage in a waka, or "Japanese poem", attributed to Ono no Komachi. Its title was later changed to <strong>Kimi no Musubime</strong> (きみの結びめ, Your Connection) and <strong>Kimi wa Kono Sekai no Hanbun</strong> (きみはこの世界のはんぶん, You Are Half of This World) before becoming <i>Kimi no Na Wa.</i> On December 31, 2014, Shinkai announced that he had been spending his days writing storyboard for this film.
    
    Inspiration for the story came from works including Shūzō Oshimi's Inside Mari, Ranma ½, the Heian period novel Torikaebaya Monogatari, and Greg Egan's short story The Safe-Deposit Box. Shinkai also cited Interstellar (2014) by Christopher Nolan as an influence.
        Wikimedia Commons has media related to Film locations of Your Name.
    
    While the town of Itomori, one of the film's settings, is fictional, the film drew inspirations from real-life locations that provided a backdrop for the town. Such locations include the city of Hida in Gifu Prefecture and its library, Hida City Library. </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Main article: Your Name (album)<br>

        Yojiro Noda, the lead vocalist of the Japanese rock band Radwimps, composed the theme music of Your Name. Director Makoto Shinkai requested him to compose its music "in a way that the music will (supplement) the dialogue or monologue of the characters".[21] Your Name features the following songs performed by Radwimps:
    <ul>
        <li>"Yumetōrō" (夢灯籠, Yumetōrō, lit. "Dream Lantern")</li>
        <li>"Zenzenzense" (前前前世, Zenzenzense, lit. "Past Past Past Life")</li>
        <li>"Sparkle" (スパークル, Supākuru)</li>
        <li>Nandemonaiya" (なんでもないや, Nandemonaiya, lit. "It's Nothing")</li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    The soundtrack of the film was well received by both audiences and critics alike and is acknowledged as being one of the factors behind its success at the box office. The film's soundtrack was the runner-up in the "Best Soundtrack" category at the 2016 Newtype Anime Awards, and the song "Zenzenzense" was the runner-up in the "Best Theme Song Category".
